          <p><span>i have no family history of cancer</span></p>
          <p><span>and this is why i shoot up testosterone</span></p>
          <p><span>and why i am confident when the lady psychologist</span></p>
          <p><span>says</span></p>
          <p><span>cancer it is often a congenital disease</span></p>
          <p><span>and if it does not appear in your family history</span></p>
          <p><span>that is good news for a hypochondriac</span></p>

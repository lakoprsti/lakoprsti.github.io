          <p>the bed is big enough for two people</p>
          <p>she and someone else</p>
          <p>a table</p>
          <p>two books</p>
          <p>she and someone else</p>
          <p>i cannot understand anyone</p>
          <p>i brought a dictionary (german croatian)</p>
          <p>and two big milka</p>
          <p>chocolate bars for lunch dinner and over night</p>
          <p>that is how i was remembering our shared life</p>
          <p>before this the two of us exchanged 73 messages</p>
          <p>each word a message</p>
          <p>enter like inhale</p>
          <p>73 more than over the last ten years</p>
          <p>more than ever before</p>
          <p>du≈æa pauza</p>
          <p>a missed call</p>
          <p>a german phone number</p>
          <p>a whatsapp message</p>
          <p>i am calling you for support and cheer i am in the hospital</p>
          <p>she quipped about the dinamo soccer team and cheering fans</p>
          <p>so far only medical tests</p>
          <p>enter like exhale</p>
          <p>i did not call</p>
          <p>because i am selfish</p>
          <p>because i wanted us to be writing</p>
          <p>to have the messages to remember</p>
          <p>to mull over later</p>
          <p>i brought a dictionary (german croatian)</p>
          <p>to read the test results</p>
          <p>there is room in the bed for two</p>
          <p>i cannot write from her perspective</p>
          <p>i cannot know how she feels</p>
          <p>i cannot write the character of the woman who is speaking to me</p>
          <p>i cannot create her motivation</p>
          <p>complexity</p>
          <p>to build a character for this text</p>
          <p>i cannot write her</p>
          <p>without knowing her</p>
          <p>but i can write about her</p>
          <p>about what she told me</p>
          <p>about us</p>
          <p>how i got to know her again now that i am a man</p>
          <p>and squeezed my eyes tight shut</p>
          <p>i try to remember when we last</p>
          <p>slept together when i was a girl</p>
          <p>there is room in the bed for two</p>
          <p>let them chop off whatever they like</p>
          <p>she said</p>
          <p>but i thought of all the texts i have been reading about the</p>
          <p>representation of women</p>
          <p>i disgust myself</p>
          <p>my own mother is writing me about her disease</p>
          <p>but my thoughts are on literature</p>
          <p>who are you to write about that</p>
          <p>on the promenade in split</p>
          <p>crammed into a cafe where they pile</p>
          <p>books by each table</p>
          <p>books that have assumed the color of coffee</p>
          <p>because nobody has ever opened them</p>
          <p>i imagined taking a glass and throwing it at</p>
          <p>the wall of the hipster cafe</p>
          <p>the whatsapp message</p>
          <p>magnetic procedure infusion up down ct then</p>
          <p>magnetic on a full stomach then antibiotic</p>
          <p>a big wound</p>
          <p>i wanted to throw a glass at the wall</p>
          <p>but all i did was respond to my cell phone</p>
          <p>calmest in the world</p>
          <p>and asked have you eaten so what is the food like</p>
          <p>that seemed logical</p>
          <p>because concern for another is manifested through</p>
          <p>feeding</p>
          <p>as if i have any idea what she likes</p>
          <p>besides chocolate</p>
          <p>two big milkas</p>
          <p>for lunch dinner and over night</p>
          <p>i eat pudding</p>
          <p>she listed the flavors for me</p>
          <p>strawberry</p>
          <p>chocolate</p>
          <p>vanilla</p>
          <p>banana</p>
          <p>she described the way the food is served in the most minute</p>
          <p>detail</p>
          <p>everything that a person who cannot eat</p>
          <p>observes</p>
          <p>because she knows that silence over the phone has</p>
          <p>special weight</p>
          <p>let them chop off whatever they like</p>
          <p>she said</p>
          <p>she laughed</p>
          <p>i said</p>
          <p>german hospitals are better than ours</p>
          <p>i do not know why</p>
          <p>i have never been to germany</p>
          <p>i know nothing about their hospitals</p>
          <p>but i wanted her to feel safe</p>
          <p>i said that and what i wanted to say was</p>
          <p>everything will be fine</p>
          <p>they have modern equipment and what matters is</p>
          <p>you decided to go to the hospital</p>
          <p>though i know this is not</p>
          <p>and then it happened to you</p>
          <p>and i ask you about the food </p>
          <p>because concern for another is manifested through</p>
          <p>food</p>
          <p>because i actually wanted you to be in the city where</p>
          <p>we were together when i was a girl</p>
          <p>where i had a mother</p>
          <p>and you had a child</p>
          <p>breathe out</p>
          <p>message</p>
          <p>pick up</p>
          <p>holy shit</p>
          <p>what is happening</p>
          <p>hi bro</p>
          <p>hey</p>
          <p>is everything okay</p>
          <p>he is crying</p>
          <p>my brother never cries</p>
          <p>is everything okay</p>
          <p>no it is not where you are</p>
          <p>in split what happened</p>
          <p>it has spread</p>
          <p>embolism to both lungs</p>
          <p>her liver</p>
          <p>pointless to operate</p>
          <p>listen i think that</p>
          <p>listen i think that</p>
          <p>long pause</p>
          <p>dunno</p>
          <p>they will prolong her life for as long as they can</p>
          <p>i say nothing</p>
          <p>are you still there he asks</p>
          <p>i am </p>
          <p>sorry</p>
          <p>i tell him sorry</p>
          <p>as if you are not my mother too</p>
          <p>i tell him sorry</p>
          <p>because you truly were that for him</p>
          <p>because you two are bonded in ways i cannot even imagine</p>
          <p>i wanted to tell him everything would be fine</p>
          <p>i did not say that to him</p>
          <p>we do not talk that way</p>
          <p>we know life is never fine</p>
          <p>sorry</p>
          <p>i repeat once more</p>
          <p>love you bro</p>
          <p>call</p>
          <p>i am here</p>
          <p>right?</p>
          <p>i go back to the table as if nothing has happened</p>
          <p>pay for the coffee</p>
          <p>walk</p>
          <p>i do not know where i am</p>
          <p>panic attacks</p>
          <p>an everyday thing</p>
          <p>nothing new</p>
          <p>cut the melodrama</p>
          <p>i repeat to myself</p>
          <p>you have no right to make yourself the victim</p>
          <p>i told my brother i love him</p>
          <p>i had not said that to him for 10 years</p>
          <p>poor me while i stand in the breeze by the sea and</p>
          <p>wait for the bus</p>
          <p>because split is a foreign city</p>
          <p>because i am nauseous</p>
          <p>because i need my bed</p>
          <p>diazepams</p>
          <p>and my bathtub</p>
          <p>because i need to be a grown up and pack my suitcase</p>
          <p>on the bus for eight hours i imagined</p>
          <p>a place you two have been existing for years</p>
          <p>a place i have never been</p>
          <p>in your room i see the blanket you covered yourself with</p>
          <p>the blanket under which i tucked my hand so often</p>
          <p>took the remote and switched off the tv when you were already</p>
          <p>fast asleep</p>
          <p>and i came in high from being out</p>
          <p>the blanket full of burn holes because you fell asleep</p>
          <p>a hundred times with a cigarette in your hand</p>
          <p>the blanket i used to cover my mouth when i</p>
          <p>vomited in the room from drugs</p>
          <p>so i would be quieter</p>
          <p>so you would not hear me</p>
          <p>i remember we had the blanket when we lived</p>
          <p>together back when i was a girl</p>
          <p>we all had it</p>
          <p>brother</p>
          <p>you</p>
          <p>and me</p>
          <p>that blanket is the only familiar thing i can</p>
          <p>connect to you</p>
          <p>i do not know you</p>
          <p>i do not even know your favorite song</p>
          <p>ever since i heard that you are dying</p>
          <p>i have been calling you mama</p>
          <p>mama</p>
          <p>mama</p>
